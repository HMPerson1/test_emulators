# Test Android Emulators on Travis

Update: see [article](https://medium.com/@nocnoc/android-emulators-in-thcloud-f39e11c15bfa) on Medium about this.

Since travis hypervisor does not support nested VMs, it is not possible to run the x86 emulators on travis.

This project tests which arm emulators run on travis and shows their start-up times.

Click on the travis badge to find out the start-up times of the tested emulators.

Feel free to submit a PR if you find more arm emulators that run on travis.
