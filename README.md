# Test Android Emulators

Since travis does not support nested hypervisors, it is not possible to run the x86 emulators on travis.

This project tests some of the arm emulators to make sure they run on travis and their start-up times.

Click on the travis badge to find out the start-up times of the tested emulators.

Feel free to submit a PR if there is faster emulator than the ones tested.
